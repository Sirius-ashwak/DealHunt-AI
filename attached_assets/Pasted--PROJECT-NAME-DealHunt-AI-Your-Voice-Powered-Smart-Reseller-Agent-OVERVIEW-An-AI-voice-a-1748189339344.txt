json
Copy
Edit
[
  {
    "seller": "SneakerZone",
    "price": 9500,
    "delivery_days": 2,
    "contact": "sneakerzone@email.com"
  },
  {
    "seller": "HypeHub",
    "price": 8999,
    "delivery_days": 4,
    "contact": "hypehub@email.com"
  },
  {
    "seller": "KicksExpress",
    "price": 10499,
    "delivery_days": 1,
    "contact": "kicksexpress@email.com"
  }
]
🔹 Step 2: OmniDimension Prompt (Voice Agent)
🧠 Sample Prompt:
sql
Copy
Edit
You are a shopping assistant helping users find the best deal on limited-edition sneakers. Ask the user their product preference and delivery urgency. Then check deals from resellers (SneakerZone, HypeHub, KicksExpress). Compare price and delivery days.

At the end of the call:
- Recommend the top 3 options
- Send these to the user’s email
- Log the full data to Google Sheets

Trigger a POST webhook to https://your-webhook-url.com with the user's preference, all offers, and top 3 selections.
🔹 Step 3: Webhook Backend (Node.js / Replit)
Handles:

Emailing top 3 options

Logging full data to Google Sheets

Want a ready-to-use Node.js Replit webhook? Let me know and I’ll generate one for you.

🔹 Step 4: Google Sheets Logging
Use:

googleapis NPM package

Create a Google Sheet with headers: User Name | Product | Seller | Price | Delivery Days | Contact | Timestamp

🔹 Step 5: Email Sample (SendGrid/Mailjet)

🚀 Advanced Features to Make DealHunt AI Stand Out:
1. 🧑‍🎤 Conversational AI Personas
Simulate different seller personalities (friendly, fast-talking, confused, etc.) using LLM prompts to make the conversations feel realistic and dynamic.

Add seller profiles with photos, ratings, and trust scores.

2. 📊 Dynamic Deal Visualizer (Live Dashboard)
Real-time chart showing:

💰 Prices across sellers

🚚 Delivery times

⭐ Ratings and trust score

Use something like Recharts in React or Chart.js to render deal comparisons live.

3. 📧 Smart Email Summary
After the voice call, send a summary email to the user with:

🥇 Top 3 ranked deals with reasons (e.g., "Fastest delivery under ₹1500")

📈 A chart image embedded (use chart snapshot)

🧠 AI Recommendation summary (e.g., “We recommend SneakerVault due to lowest price + 2-day shipping”)

4. 📥 PDF Export of Deals
Auto-generate a downloadable PDF of the full comparison including:

Seller name

Price

Delivery ETA

Call transcript

AI recommendation

5. 🔊 User Voice Input: "What’s my priority?"
Let the user say their preference (e.g., “I care more about fast delivery” or “price under ₹2000”).

Use this to re-rank the deals dynamically and give a personalized recommendation.

6. 📞 Voice Memory & Replay
After each call, let the user replay parts of the seller’s response.

“What did Seller 2 say about delivery?” — let the agent answer or replay the voice clip.

7. 💬 Chat + Voice Hybrid Agent
Add a chat interface to complement voice commands.

E.g., User can type “compare prices again” or “email just top 2”.

8. 🔐 Trust Score Analysis
Give each seller a trust score based on:

Their tone (analyzed from the voice)

Delivery time consistency

Past reviews (mocked or from fake dataset)

9. 🧩 GPT-Fusion Prompting (OmniPrompt)
Create a unified prompt system that takes:

📸 Image (optional — e.g., product photo)

🔊 Voice (user's preferences)

📝 Text (past purchase behavior)

→ And gives tailored suggestions.

10. 📡 OmniWebhook™ Integration

Log data to Google Sheets

Send email with SendGrid / Gmail API
